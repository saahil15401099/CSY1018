  <p>   <u><strong><h1>My ethic</h1></strong></u>
      I am a young, charismatic, enthusiastic and social person. I am not hesitant
      to meet new people and make new friends.  I am very keen to learn new skills
      and build on old ones. I have strong communication and exceptional customer
      services (that I have provided in my previous jobs). I am energetic
      considering I go to the gym and live a healthy lifestyle; I'm also
      flexible at managing time. I enjoy being in a busy sales environment so
      I can use my skills that I have learn't and also develop new ones.
      I am good with all sort of technology-
      such as the top brand like Apple, Dell, Sony, Samsung and also putting sales
      through the tills- so I am technology literate. From this I have computing
      skills as well as sale skills. I like working in both teamwork and also
      independently environments when working in a store to make more out of my time.
      Problem solving is my main skill that I have learnt through school and
      also my experiences through work. I have the ability to work under pressure
      and from that I am confident that I will make excellent sales where ever
      I will work.

  <h2> <b><u>Skills</u></b></h2>
  <p>
    Phones4U           (November 2013- May 2014)
             Sales advisor/assistant
I used to work at Phones4u; I find the job interesting as it is more than just
retail. My job title requires a lot of skills; walking up to customers making
good customer relations. processing and scanning products- and from this we have
targets to hit so we have to keep our self's motivated to make sure we hit our
target every day, making out work areas looking clean, wearing out uniforms
appropriately and look tidy, and also making sure we give our customer service
is 10/10 all the time- so we can guaranty them coming back to the store and
keeping a positive reflection of the company.<br></p>

<p>Burger King          (January- June 2015)
              Stocking/ till work
My previous job was working at Burger King in the Centre MK. I found the job
very different to what my other jobs were like as i was doing more of stocking
of shelves; this was the harder part of my job as i was lifting different sizes
of boxes. I also did till work, i find that with my IT skills it was easier
for me to understand the concept of using the till and found it easy to use.
overall i have learnt a couple of things as its different from my other jobs
is that you must make sure the customer feels comfortable with you when i
am taking an order or even make sure that you can work independently and as
a team.<br></p>

<p>Welcome break          (November 2015- June 2016)
              Host/ Security
This is my current job, working as a host/ security guard at the Game-zone.
The skills required are to make sure 18 year olds were only allowed in the
facility, also making sure I clean all the slot machines for healthy and safety
purposes. Making sure customers feel comfortable and happy playing on the site.
There are responsibilities taken such as making sure there are no robberies
taken place or if there is any issues, that I would take initiative and solve
the problem independently or if I need help with the situation, work as a
team and find a solution.<br>
